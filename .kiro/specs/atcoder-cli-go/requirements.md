# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a Go-based command-line interface tool for AtCoder competitive programming platform. The tool will provide functionality to download contest problems, generate template code, test solutions locally, and submit solutions to AtCoder. This is a fork/reimplementation of the unmaintained atcoder-cli project, designed to be more maintainable and performant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to authenticate with AtCoder, so that I can access contest problems and submit solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the login command THEN the system SHALL prompt for AtCoder username and password
2. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL store authentication cookies securely
3. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit
4. WHEN the user runs a command requiring authentication AND no valid session exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to download contest problems, so that I can work on them locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies a contest ID THEN the system SHALL download all problems for that contest
2. WHEN downloading problems THEN the system SHALL create a directory structure for each problem
3. WHEN downloading problems THEN the system SHALL save problem statements as markdown files
4. WHEN downloading problems THEN the system SHALL save sample input/output test cases
5. IF a contest does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to generate template code files, so that I can start coding solutions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading a problem THEN the system SHALL generate a template source code file
2. WHEN generating templates THEN the system SHALL support multiple programming languages (Go, C++, Python, etc.)
3. WHEN generating templates THEN the system SHALL include basic structure and common imports
4. WHEN a custom template is configured THEN the system SHALL use the custom template instead of default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to test my solutions locally, so that I can verify correctness before submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the test command THEN the system SHALL compile the solution if necessary
2. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL run the solution against all sample test cases
3. WHEN a test case passes THEN the system SHALL display a success indicator
4. WHEN a test case fails THEN the system SHALL display expected vs actual output
5. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL display compilation errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to submit my solutions to AtCoder, so that I can participate in contests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the submit command THEN the system SHALL detect the programming language automatically
2. WHEN submitting THEN the system SHALL upload the solution to the correct problem
3. WHEN submission is successful THEN the system SHALL display the submission ID and status
4. WHEN submission fails THEN the system SHALL display the error reason
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prompt for login before submission

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to configure the tool settings, so that I can customize it to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the config command THEN the system SHALL allow setting default programming language
2. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom template file paths
3. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL allow setting workspace directory
4. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL persist settings across sessions
5. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to view contest and problem information, so that I can understand what I'm working on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests contest info THEN the system SHALL display contest name, duration, and problem list
2. WHEN the user requests problem info THEN the system SHALL display problem title, time limit, and memory limit
3. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL format output in a readable manner
4. IF contest or problem doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message
